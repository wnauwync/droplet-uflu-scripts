Droplet uflu analysis tools

## DropTop GUI
dropTop is a tkinter based GUI for image-based droplet analysis.
Given a frame rate and a flow rate, it will derive the frequency of droplet generation (Hz), the droplet size (pL) and the interdroplet time (ms).



## Droplet Counter package
dropletCounter.py contains two main functions (dropletCounter and plotData) and numerous helper functions.

### dropletCounter(directory,flowrate,newTxt,newGif = false)  
**Input:**
- directory: directory name containing the droplet images to be analyzed (syntax: YYYYMMDD_camerafps)
- flowrate: flow rate (uL/hr) used during droplet production
- newTxt: if set to True a new tsv file is generated. If false it will append to the most recent tsv file.
- newGif: if set to True a new gif file is generated of processed images. Slows down code considerably.

**Output:**  
- tsv-file (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.tsv) with date, time, frequency, droplets size
- optional: processed droplet images gif

### plotData(fileName)  
**Input:**
- directory: tsv filename (no path) with droplet data generated by dropletCounter function.  
Note: if no argument is passed, most recent tsv file is plotted

**Output:**  
- png file with droplet data plotted in time.
